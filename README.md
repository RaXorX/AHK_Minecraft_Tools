### Important Reminders
1. AutoHotkey must be installed before using this script, duh!
2. This Script only works for the following window size: 1280 x 720.
3. Caption (subtitle) must be turned ON in Minecraft's setting.
4. Gui scale must be set to 2 in Minecraft's setting.
5. Works for all applicable Minecraft versions up to the latest version.

### Limitations and Known Bugs
1. Auto-Sweep Attack only triggers when there's a **Sword Icon** below the crosshair and works best when pointed at dark-colored mobs. Pointing the crosshair on light-colors (e.g. white, yellow etc.) will trigger the Auto-Sweep Attack continuously. The Sword Icon visibility is essential for it to work.
